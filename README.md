# spIsoNet version 1.0

Update on Feb 7 2024

Single Particle spIsoNet (spIsoNet) is designed to correct for the preferred orientation problem in cryoEM by self-supervised deep learning, by recovering missing information from well-sampled orientations in Fourier space. Unlike conventional supervised deep learning methods that need explicit input-output pairs for training, spIsoNet autonomously extracts supervisory signals from the original data, ensuring the reliability of the information used for training.

# 1. Installation

We suggest using anaconda environment to manage the spIsoNet package.

1. Install cudatoolkit and cudnn on your computer.
2. Install pytorch from https://pytorch.org/ 
3. Create an conda virtual environment and install dependencies by running install.sh in the spIsoNet folder or by pip install
   The dependencies include tqdm, matplotlib, scipy, numpy, scikit-image, mrcfile, fire
4. For example, add the following lines in your ~/.bashrc

    export PATH=PATH_TO_ISONET_FOLDER/bin:$PATH 

    export PYTHONPATH=PATH_TO_PARENT_FOLDER_OF_ISONET_FOLDER:$PYTHONPATH 
    or you can run source source-env.sh in your terminal, which will export required variables into your environment.
5. Now spIsoNet is available to use.

The environment we verified are:
1. cuda11.8 cudnn8.5 pytorch2.0.1, pytorch installed with pip.
2. cuda11.3 cudnn8.2 pytorch1.13.1, pytorch installed with conda.
